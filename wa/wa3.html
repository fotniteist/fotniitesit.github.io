    <h1>Coconut</h1>
    <p>The <strong>coconut tree (Cocos nucifera)</strong> is a member of the palm tree family (Arecaceae) and the only living species 
    of the genus <strong>Cocos</strong>. The term <strong>"coconut"</strong> (or the archaic <strong>"cocoanut"</strong>) can refer to the whole coconut palm, the seed, 
    or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut. The name comes from the old Portuguese word coco, meaning "head" 
    or "skull", after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. They are ubiquitous in coastal 
    tropical regions and are a cultural icon of the tropics.</p>
