    <h2>Page 1</h2>
        <p>I had to close a list and table that were left open.
        I also had to add a language to the html document.</p>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
        <p>Closed element b at the beginning and swtiched a b tag with an h2 tag to make the nesting correct.
            Added a link for a wiki page for in segmentended arch.
            Lastly, added the correct tags to fix the History headline.
        </p>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <p> I linked the style sheet and then cleaned up tags through the code.</p>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <p>All the images needed alt tags for the images. Also some of the images needed at starting td tag.</p>
